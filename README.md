# rust_tracing
My implementation of the Ray Tracing in One Weekend book in Rust

## Branches

- The `windowed` (default) branch implements a windowing system to display the renders. Maybe I'll add a UI in the future.
- The `book-weekend` branch is just the plain implementation with nothing added to it
