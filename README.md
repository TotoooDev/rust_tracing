# rust_tracing
My implementation of the [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book in Rust

## Branches

- The `windowed` (default) branch implements a windowing system to display the renders. Maybe I'll add a UI in the future.
- The `book-weekend` branch is just the plain implementation with nothing added to it
